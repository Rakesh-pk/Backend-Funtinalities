**Transport Layer Security (TLS) is crucial for securing email communication. Here are some key reasons why TLS is essential when sending emails:**

* Confidentiality: 
    TLS encrypts the content of email messages, preventing unauthorized access to the email's text, attachments, and other data. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the email.
* Authentication: 
    TLS provides a mechanism for verifying the identity of the email server you are connecting to. This helps in ensuring that you are sending your email to the legitimate recipient and not to a malicious server.
* Reduced Risk of Phishing: 
    TLS helps recipients trust the authenticity of incoming emails. This can help reduce the risk of phishing attacks where malicious actors impersonate legitimate senders.
* Protection from Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: 
    TLS safeguards against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where an attacker intercepts and potentially modifies email messages between sender and recipient.
* Data Integrity: 
    TLS helps maintain the integrity of the email during transmission. It ensures that the email content hasn't been tampered with or altered in transit.
